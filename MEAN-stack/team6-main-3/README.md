# Introduction:

International Student plays a very important role in the growth and success of every University. When arriving at school, there are many problems faced by International students and it is very difficult for them to find all the related information on one platform. So, considering this issue we are developing a web application which is designed with the perspective of International student/Transfer student  and International office to ensure the easy shift from their home country to the United States. Our project is a full-fledged web-based application that provides a comprehensive solution to an International studentâ€™s need. This is a robust system, which allows user-based permission on modules, pages, and even controls inside pages.
